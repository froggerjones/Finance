# Write a program that calculates the compound interest on a savings account, 
# given the principal, annual interest rate, number of years and compound frequency.

# Step One: create the inputs using the parameters above (principal, rate, time).
# Step Two: write the formula for compound interest using input parameters.
# Print Result.

# Step One: Inputs

principal = float(input("Enter the Principal Amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the Interest Rate: "))
years = int(input("Enter the number of Years: "))
frequency = int(input("Enter the nb. of times the interest is compounded per year: "))


# Step Two: Formula

def compound_interest(principal, rate, years, frequency):
    return principal * (1 + (rate/100) / frequency) ** (frequency * years)


# Step Three: Print Result

compound = compound_interest(principal, rate, years, frequency)
print 'The compound interest after ',years,' years, compounding ',frequency,' times per year is: ',round(compound,2),'euros'
